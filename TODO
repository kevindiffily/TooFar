Next:
Move kasa logic to devices and logic into the device handlers
simplify handlers, use a single map[ip]device instead of one per platform
other cleanups/refactors now that we have many platforms and device types
much of the hc/ logic needs to be pushed to the proper handlers, strip that one to the core

Soon:
Why doesn't adding the AirQuality sensor to the OWM device work?

Later:
Improve LinuxSensors to support fans and other sensors
Figure out and add support for WifiCapabilities -- requres work in HomeControl -- No good docs out there
